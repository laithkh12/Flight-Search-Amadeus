# Flight Deal Tracker
This project tracks flight prices between specified cities and sends notifications to registered users when deals are found. By leveraging the Amadeus and Sheety APIs, it retrieves real-time flight data and updates Google Sheets with the best available deals. Notifications are sent through SMS, WhatsApp, or email when a price lower than a set threshold is detected.
